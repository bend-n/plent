# you want your own schematic repository? look no further.

if you dont know what a schematic repository is, look at [design-it](<https://github.com/bend-n/design-it>).
its technology that lets your community upload schematics to a repository, which can then be pulled down by the [schembrowser](<https://github.com/sbxte/mindustry-schematic-browser>) mod.

now, if you want this, or somebody in your community is bugging you to add this, here are the steps.

- <:right:1182119750155915264> invite bendn (<:discord:1182124785371729990> `bendn_` <@696196765564534825>) to your server.
- create a <:github_square:1182121451655004221> github repository and account for your server, or ask bendn or somebody in your community to do it for you.
- elect <:admin:1182128872435749005> administrators of the schematic repository, certain trusted users.
- create a discord channel, or three, for your schematics to go in, along with tags for each channel if you need them.
- add an emote <:deny:1192388789952319499> for the administrators to react with to bad schems to delete them (or dont, if you dont want the schematics to ever go away).
- create a [github PAT](<https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Schematic%20Repo&scopes=repo>) and send it to bendn (<:warning:1182119952048726066> privately!)
- wait for bendn to add your repo to me!
